### About the Experiment 

This experiment aims to carry out simplified load calculation and problem formulation for structural analysis of a 3D frame structure by breaking it into 2D frames. It deals with computation of dead loads (slabs and floor finish, beams and columns), imposed (live) loads and earthquake loads.
